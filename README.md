# 3D-Jet-Plane-Loader
Loads data from a .dat file which represents a 3D Jet Model. 

This application follows the MVC Architectural Pattern as can be observed by seeing the model, view and controller packages. That's why it also possesses a separate GUI for interaction with the 3D Model.

It loads data in Tecplot ASCII format and renders it to be displayed. The application supports rotation & translation with the mouse (by keepong track of mouse events), pseduo coloring and wireframe display of the model. Additionally, we can also change the view: Orthographic and Perspective. The code is documented throghout which makes it easier to understand.
